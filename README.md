# Design Patterns in C# ðŸš€  

A collection of **Creational, Structural, and Behavioral** design patterns implemented in **C#**, with concise explanations and code examples. This repository serves as a handy reference for understanding and applying design patterns in real-world projects.

## ðŸ“Œ Design Patterns Covered  

### âœ… Creational Design Patterns  
- **Singleton** â€“ Ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it.  
- **Factory** â€“ Creates objects without specifying the exact class of the object to be created.  
- **Abstract Factory** â€“ Provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.  
- **Builder** â€“ Separates the construction of a complex object from its representation, allowing the same construction process to create different representations.  

### âœ… Structural Design Patterns  
- **Adapter** â€“ Allows incompatible interfaces to work together by converting the interface of one class into an interface expected by the clients.  
- **Bridge** â€“ Decouples an abstraction from its implementation so that the two can vary independently.  

### âœ… Behavioral Design Patterns  
- **Observer** â€“ Defines a one-to-many dependency between objects, so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically.  
- **Strategy** â€“ Enables selecting an algorithmâ€™s behavior at runtime by defining a family of algorithms and making them interchangeable.

This repository follows a structured branching strategy:  

- `main` â€“ The stable and production-ready branch.  
- `dev` â€“ The development branch where new changes are merged before moving to `main`.  
- `creational-singleton` â€“ Implementation of the Singleton pattern.  
- `creational-factory` â€“ Implementation of the Factory pattern.  
- `creational-abstract_factory` â€“ Implementation of the Abstract Factory pattern.  
- `creational-builder` â€“ Implementation of the Builder pattern.  
- `structural-adapter` â€“ Implementation of the Adapter pattern.  
- `structural-bridge` â€“ Implementation of the Bridge pattern.  
- `behavioral-observer` â€“ Implementation of the Observer pattern.  
- `behavioral-strategy` â€“ Implementation of the Strategy pattern.
