# Design Patterns in C#

This repository contains implementations of various design patterns in C#. Each pattern is explained with code examples and use cases.

## 🏗️ What are Design Patterns?
Design patterns are best practices used by software developers to solve common problems in software design. They provide a standard approach to solving recurring design issues.

## 📂 Repository Structure
The repository is structured based on the three main categories of design patterns:

📦 Design-Patterns │── 📁 Creational │ ├── FactoryMethod │ ├── AbstractFactory │ ├── Singleton │ ├── Builder │ ├── Prototype │── 📁 Structural │ ├── Adapter │ ├── Bridge │ ├── Composite │ ├── Decorator │ ├── Facade │ ├── Flyweight │ ├── Proxy │── 📁 Behavioral │ ├── ChainOfResponsibility │ ├── Command │ ├── Interpreter │ ├── Iterator │ ├── Mediator │ ├── Memento │ ├── Observer │ ├── State │ ├── Strategy │ ├── TemplateMethod │ ├── Visitor │── 📁 Common │ ├── UtilityClasses │ ├── Interfaces │── README.md

## 🛠️ How to Use
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/22rahulrai/Design-Patterns.git
Open the project in Visual Studio.

Navigate to the desired pattern folder and run the corresponding C# file to see the implementation.

📚 Design Patterns Covered
Creational Patterns
Factory Method - Creates objects without specifying the exact class.

Abstract Factory - Provides an interface for creating families of related objects.

Singleton - Ensures a class has only one instance.

Builder - Separates object construction from representation.

Prototype - Creates objects by copying an existing object.

Structural Patterns
Adapter - Converts one interface into another.

Bridge - Decouples abstraction from implementation.

Composite - Treats individual and composite objects uniformly.

Decorator - Adds behavior to objects dynamically.

Facade - Provides a simplified interface to a complex system.

Flyweight - Reduces memory usage by sharing objects.

Proxy - Controls access to another object.

Behavioral Patterns
Chain of Responsibility - Passes requests along a chain of handlers.

Command - Encapsulates a request as an object.

Interpreter - Defines a grammar and interprets expressions.

Iterator - Provides a way to access elements sequentially.

Mediator - Reduces dependencies between objects.

Memento - Captures and restores an object's state.

Observer - Defines a dependency between objects.

State - Allows an object to alter its behavior when its state changes.

Strategy - Defines a family of algorithms and makes them interchangeable.

Template Method - Defines the skeleton of an algorithm in a base class.

Visitor - Adds operations to objects without modifying them.
